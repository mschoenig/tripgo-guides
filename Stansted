Stansted airport is outside the Oyster Card area, so you need to buy a ticket before your trip.
If you're planning to take Stansted Express, check <https://www.stanstedexpress.com/> for cheaper tickets in advance.
There are no taxi ranks at the airport, however you can just book your cab through TripGo.
If you’re planning to take a coach (such as easyBus) or express train, check online for cheaper tickets in advance. Keep in mind that times for coaches can vary a little due to traffic, and that you often commit to a specific time when booking a coach.
