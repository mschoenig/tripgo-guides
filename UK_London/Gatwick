You can use Oyster or contactless payment options on the trains to/from Gatwick Airport, however it may be cheaper to buy rail tickets. Please also note that you cannot use travelcards to/from Gatwick Airport.
If youâ€™re planning to take a coach (such as easyBus) or express train, check online for cheaper tickets in advance. Keep in mind that times for coaches can vary a little due to traffic, and that you often commit to a specific time when booking a coach.
