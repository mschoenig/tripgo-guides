Walking is a great option to get around in London while experiencing the city, no matter if you live here or are just visiting. Keep in mind that cars drive on the left in the UK when crossing streets, and look to your right first.
Safety:Â London is generally very safe but as a rule of thumb, keep belongings close, don't walk alone after dark and keep to well-lit main roads when walking at night.
