The public transport system works really well in London, and parking fees, the congestion charge, traffic jams, petrol prices etc mean taking the car is often not the best option. However, if you do decide to get behind on the bike we have some tips for you:

-   Keep in mind that you ride on the left side of the road in the UK

-   Like in many other countries, using a mobile phone to call or text while driving is illegal (but you can use a hands-free device)

-   Don't worry about the Congestion Zone (you will see a large white 'C' in a red circle), it doesn't apply to motorbikes. Yay!
