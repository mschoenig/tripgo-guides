London's bike sharing system is called [Santander Cycle](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles), affectionately nicknamed Boris Bikes. You can use your debit/credit card to hire a Santander Cycle instantly from any of the many stations around London.\
If you make trips of less than 30 minutes each, you can cycle for as long as you like with your £2 a day (just leave 5 minutes between trips). If you don't return your bike to a station within 30 minutes, you pay an additional £2 for every 30 minutes.

TripGo will show you how many bikes are available using color coding and a fill level; just tap on any of the bike sharing symbols on the map. An all black circle means no bikes left, a little red area for few bikes and if it's full and dark green all bikes at the station are available. On the flip side, a full dark green symbol means no free docks, so when you return your bike make sure there's at least a little black visible in the circle.

Tip: If you find it difficult to pull the bike free from its dock, bounce the back wheel up and down first.
