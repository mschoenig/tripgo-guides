As in any other city, use common sense and curtesy when using public transport. When travelling for leisure, try to avoid rush hour (between 6:30am and 9:30am, and 4:00pm and 7:00pm from Monday through Friday). If you can’t avoid travelling during rush hour, take your backpack off so you don’t accidentally bump into other people or things with it.

On hot days, bus and tram are usually a more pleasant experience than the Tube. Just touch in with your Oyster or contactless card, no need to touch off. Ensure you ring the bell (if no one else has done so yet) well before if you want to get off at the next stop. Check the trip in TripGo to see where you are and where the tram stops.
