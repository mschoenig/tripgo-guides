Getting a cab: You can hail a black cab if the 'For Hire' sign is lit up. Stand on the side of the road and stick out your arm to let the cab driver know you'd like a lift.\
Alternatively find a cab at a taxi rank (e.g. at stations, airports, outside big hotels).

Costs: Taxis are generally comfortable and safe, but also expensive. Check the estimated trip cost using TripGo before you get into a cab. You can tip as much as you'd like, but standard etiquette is to round up to the nearest pound. Note that taxis accept cash or credit card payments, but no Oyster Cards.

Safety: Only black cabs are allowed to pick up travellers on the street. So if you get an offer for a lift from an unmarked or unregistered vehicle, always refuse. Not only might they overcharge you but they are also less safe than registered taxis.
