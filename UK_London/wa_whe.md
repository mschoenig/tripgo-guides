If mobility is an issue for you, e.g. if you travel by wheelchair or push a pram, ensure you enable accessibility information in TripGo. It's easy: tap on Profile -> Transport and scroll to the bottom, then tap on the + symbol next to Wheelchair if it's not included in your options (this excludes "Walking" automatically).

On public transport\
Buses, trams, Emirates Air Line and DLR are great choices for wheelchair users and those with impaired mobility. However, it's better to avoid the Tube, as only a quarter of stations have step-free access. The [TfL site](https://tfl.gov.uk/transport-accessibility/wheelchair-access-and-avoiding-stairs) is a great resource for further information on this.\
