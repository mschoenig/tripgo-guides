Luton airport is outside the Oyster Card area, so you need to buy a ticket before your trip.
If you take the 888 and Luton Express, make sure to get a ticket to/from Luton Airport (not Parkway), as this includes the bus in your fare.
There are no taxi ranks at the airport, however you can just book your cab through TripGo.
If youâ€™re planning to take a coach (such as easyBus) or express train, check online for cheaper tickets in advance. Keep in mind that times for coaches can vary a little due to traffic, and that you often commit to a specific time when booking a coach.
