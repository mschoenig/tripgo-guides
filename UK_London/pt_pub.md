# Public transport tickets

If you’re about to travel or already in London, chances are you’ve heard of the [Oyster Card](https://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/getting-around-london/oyster-faqs/the-basics). This is a rechargeable smart card you can use for contactless payments on most public transport options in London. You can also, however, use a contactless payment card (e.g. your standard Visa card) or Android/Apple Pay. Just tap in and out as you would with an Oyster Card.
