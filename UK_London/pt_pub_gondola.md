As in any other city, use common sense and curtesy when using public transport. When travelling for leisure, try to avoid rush hour (between 6:30am and 9:30am, and 4:00pm and 7:00pm from Monday through Friday). If you can’t avoid travelling during rush hour, take your backpack off so you don’t accidentally bump into other people or things with it.

The Emirates Air Line is a cable car linking the Royal Docks in East London with North Greenwich some 90m above the Thames. The journey is brief and not cheap, but the views are stunning.
