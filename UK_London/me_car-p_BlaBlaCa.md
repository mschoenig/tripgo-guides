[BlaBlaCar](https://www.blablacar.co.uk/)Â might be a great alternative to get where you want to go, while getting to know a nice person from around the area and reducing overall emissions. The service offers carpooling, meaning drivers list from where to where they go when, and you can book a seat (or several) to join them.
