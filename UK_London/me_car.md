The public transport system works really well in London, and parking fees, the congestion charge, traffic jams, petrol prices etc mean taking the car is often not the best option. However, if you do decide to get behind the wheel (or on the motorbike) we have some tips for you:

-   Keep in mind that you drive on the left side of the road in the UK

-   Like in many other countries, using a mobile phone to call or text while driving is illegal (but you can use a hands-free device)

-   If you enter the Congestion Zone (you will see a large white 'C' in a red circle, see picture above) between 7am and 6pm on Monday to Friday, you need to pay the congestion charge in advance or on the day to avoid being fined (<https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge>)
